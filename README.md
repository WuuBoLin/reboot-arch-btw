Kernel Updated
==============

This is a small utility which shows the installed and running Linux kernel on
[ArchLinux](https://www.archlinux.org). It is useful if one didn't notice that
the kernel got updated and suddenly your USB drive won't mount because the
needed kernel module can't get loaded.
